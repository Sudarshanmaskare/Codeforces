Polycarp remembered the 2020-th year, and he is happy with the arrival of the new 2021-th year. To remember such a wonderful moment,
Polycarp wants to represent the number n as the sum of a certain number of 2020 and a certain number of 2021.

For example, if:

n=4041, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2020+2021;
n=4042, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2021+2021;
n=8081, then the number n can be represented as the sum 2020+2020+2020+2021;
n=8079, then the number n cannot be represented as the sum of the numbers 2020 and 2021.
Help Polycarp to find out whether the number n can be represented as the sum of a certain number of numbers 2020 and a certain number of numbers 2021.



void solve() {
    
    ll t,n;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        cin>>n;
        ll mod = n % 2020;
        ll div = n / 2020;

        if( mod <= div){
            cout<<"YES"<<endl;
        }
        else{
            cout<<"NO"<<endl;
        }
    }
    
}
