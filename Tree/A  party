A company has n employees numbered from 1 to n. Each employee either has no immediate manager or exactly one immediate manager, 
who is another employee with a different number. An employee A is said to be the superior of another employee B if at least one of the following is true:

Employee A is the immediate manager of employee B
Employee B has an immediate manager employee C such that employee A is the superior of employee C.
The company will not have a managerial cycle. That is, there will not exist an employee who is the superior of his/her own immediate manager.

Today the company is going to arrange a party. This involves dividing all n employees into several groups: every employee must belong to exactly one group. Furthermore, within any single group, there must not be two employees A and B such that A is the superior of B.

What is the minimum number of groups that must be formed?


solution:

vector<int> adj[200005];
int parent[200005];
int col[200005];
int dis[200005];
unordered_map<int, vector<int>> mp;
void dfs(int node, int par) {
    int src = 0;
    for (auto var : mp[node]) {
        if (var != par) {
            dfs(var, node);
            src = max(src, 1 + dis[var]);
        }
    }
    dis[node] = src;
}
 
 
void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int node;
        cin >> node;
        if (node == -1) {
            mp[0].push_back(i);
        }
        else {
            mp[node].push_back(i);
        }
    }
    dfs(0, -1);
    cout << dis[0];
 
 
}
