Once upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail. Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. 
Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. 
You are given the values pi — the index of the router to which the i-th router was connected after being purchased (pi<i).

There are n routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the n-th router.

Input
The first line contains integer number n (2≤n≤200000) — the number of the routers.
The following line contains n−1 integers p2,p3,…,pn (1≤pi<i), where pi is equal to index of the router to which the i-th was connected after purchase.

Output
Print the path from the 1-st to the n-th router. It starts with 1 and ends with n. All the elements in the path should be distinct.





Solution :
vector<int> adj[200005];
int parent[200005];
bool vis[200005];
int dis[200005];
void dfs(int node, int par, int n) {
    vis[node] = true;
 
    for (auto var : adj[node]) {
        if (var != par) {
            parent[var] = node;
            if (var == n) return;
            dfs(var, node, n);
        }
    }
}
 
 
void solve() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int i = 2;
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        int temp;
        cin >> temp;
        //cout << temp;
        adj[temp].push_back(i);
        adj[i].push_back(temp);
        i++;
    }
 
    dfs(1, -1, n);
 
    vector<int> ans;
    while (n != 1) {
        ans.push_back(n);
        n = parent[n];
    }
    ans.push_back(1);
 
    while (ans.size()) {
        cout << ans.back() << " ";
        ans.pop_back();
    }
 
 
}
