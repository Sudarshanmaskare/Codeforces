You have a card deck of n cards, numbered from top to bottom, i. e. the top card has index 1 and bottom card — index n. Each card has its color: the i-th card has color ai.

You should process q queries. The j-th query is described by integer tj. For each query you should:

find the highest card in the deck with color tj, i. e. the card with minimum index;
print the position of the card you found;
take the card and place it on top of the deck.


void solve() {

    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    map<int, int> mp;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int temp;
        cin >> temp;
        if (mp[temp] == 0) {
            mp[temp] = i + 1;
        }
    }

    while (q--) {
        int temp;
        cin >> temp;
        int cal = mp[temp];
        cout << cal << " ";
        mp.erase(temp);
        for (auto var : mp) {
            if (var.second < cal) {
                mp[var.first] = var.second + 1;
            }
        }
        mp[temp] = 1;
    }
    cout << endl;




}
